# INSPECTOR PROLOG

In this logbook we summarize our research work and develop it throughout the semester.

This week, we focused on brainstorming ideas for our murder mystery project and discussing how to implement them using Prolog programming. We decided that the project would involve creating a murder mystery game in which the player would have to solve the murder by using clues and scenarios.

We started by discussing the different types of clues and scenarios that we could use in the game. We identified that the clues and scenarios should be carefully chosen to ensure that they are relevant to the story and that they help the player to solve the murder.

After discussing the different options, we came up with a list of possible clues and scenarios. We then evaluated each option based on its relevance to the story, its complexity, and its feasibility for implementation using Prolog.

We also took some time to prepare for our presentation and create a Gantt diagram. The Gantt diagram will provide a visual representation of our project timeline and goals. It will help us to keep track of our progress and ensure that we are staying on track to meet our deadlines.

For next week, we will work on narrowing down our list of clues and scenarios and choosing the ones that are most relevant and feasible for implementation in Prolog. We will also begin to learn Prolog programming and work on structure of the game.

In the second week of our Murder Mystery Project in Prolog Programming, we focused on learning how to program in Prolog and becoming familiar with the Swish environment. We used the resource "The Power of Prolog" by Markus Triska, which proved to be an excellent reference in understanding the language and syntax of Prolog. We learned how to write facts and basic rules that would help our program determine who the murderer is in our murder mystery game. We also learned how to interact with users by allowing them to make guesses and comparing their answers to the correct ones.

As we began to develop our program, we realized that we needed to find a way to constrain the clues step by step to make the game more engaging and challenging. We plan to consult the following resources to further our understanding of how to write constraints and rules for puzzle games in Prolog:

1. "Learn Prolog Now!" by Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and Kristina Striegnitz
2. "The Art of Prolog" by Leon Sterling and Ehud Shapiro
3. "Constraining Prolog Clauses for Puzzles" by William F. Clocksin
4. "Puzzles in Prolog" by James F. Allen

By studying these resources and experimenting with different approaches, we hope to find a method for constraining clues step by step in Prolog. Overall, we are excited about the progress we have made so far and look forward to continuing our work next week.
