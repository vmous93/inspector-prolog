# INSPECTOR PROLOG

In this logbook we summarize our research work and develop it throughout the semester.


### (1st Week) 07.03.2023

This week, we focused on brainstorming ideas for our murder mystery project and discussing how to implement them using Prolog programming. We decided that the project would involve creating a murder mystery game in which the player would have to solve the murder by using clues and scenarios.

We started by discussing the different types of clues and scenarios that we could use in the game. We identified that the clues and scenarios should be carefully chosen to ensure that they are relevant to the story and that they help the player to solve the murder.

After discussing the different options, we came up with a list of possible clues and scenarios. We then evaluated each option based on its relevance to the story, its complexity, and its feasibility for implementation using Prolog.

We also took some time to prepare for our presentation and create a Gantt diagram. The Gantt diagram will provide a visual representation of our project timeline and goals. It will help us to keep track of our progress and ensure that we are staying on track to meet our deadlines.

For next week, we will work on narrowing down our list of clues and scenarios and choosing the ones that are most relevant and feasible for implementation in Prolog. We will also begin to learn Prolog programming and work on structure of the game.
