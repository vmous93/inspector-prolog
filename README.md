# INSPECTOR PROLOG

The goal of this project is to create an educational game based on logic programming. The idea is to find out who the murderer is with a list of facts, in the manner of a detective on a crime scene. We must create a list of rules to gather evidence and help users track down the murderer.

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A murder mystery game where the player, assumed to be a detective, tries to solve a murder by entering the murder weapon, location, day, motive, and suspect. The program uses a set of rules to determine which suspect committed the crime based on the entered information and check with the player’s guess.

**List of evidence:**
1. MURDER WEAPONS: Knife, Wrench, Rope, Pistol, Candlestick, Poison
2. LOCATIONS: Kitchen, Library, Dining room, Bedroom, Garage, Garden, Pool
3. WEEKDAYS: Friday, Saturday, Sunday
4. MOTIVES: Revenge, Heritage, Money, Passion, Hatred

**Suspects:**
- Miss Scarlett
- Colonel Mustard
- Mayor Green
- Mrs. Peacock
- Professor Plum
- Miss Peach
- Monsieur Brunette

**Ex)**
“On Saturday morning, Leon Flusk, a wealthy businessman, was discovered dead in the library of his mansion, having sustained a gunshot wound. The crime scene is in disarray, with desk drawers pulled out and papers strewn about.”

“Mrs. Peacock, the victim’s wife, found his body Saturday morning and called the police. On Friday afternoon, Mayor Green, his business partner, had a meeting with the victim when the victim was alone at home. Colonel Mustard is a wanted serial killer.  Monsieur Brunette is a famous thief that arrested Friday night with a bag full of money and jewelry two blocks away from the victim’s house.“

**WHO IS THE KILLER?**
Monsieur Brunette, Library, Pistol, Friday, Money

#### What do we expect?
- For each crime we have only one murderer, But we will try to make it something score based.
- Use Language models to write the scenarios based on the list of clues and suspects.
- Make a graphical user interface.
